# Store_Management
This application was developed as part of a university course. It is written in C and runs in the console, where I aimed to make the interface as pleasant as possible.
 
# ADMIN
The application is designed for store management and supports two types of users: Admin and Customer. Navigation is performed using the arrow keys.

<h2> PROJECT MEASURES </h2>

During the use of the application, many actions are possible on the part of the user, therefore we have implemented many protection measures, 
and in case the user adds something that the program cannot process, an error message will appear, and the user will be asked to try again date. 
Messages such as the following may appear during the use of the application
